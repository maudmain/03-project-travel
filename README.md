# 03-project-travel: California Travel

## Project objectives:
in this activity, we needed to review a creative brief, and code a webpage for Travel Calfiornia using Boostrap 4, HTML, and CSS.

Brief provided by edx front end developer bootcamp: 
A creative brief’s purpose is to help guide your design decisions when you receive a design from a product manager or client. A creative brief communicates how a design should look, feel, and emulate the style of the design they’re looking for.


As a developer, we use redlined wireframes to better understand the layout handed off to us, so we have a visual idea of how we want to go about coding up the page. When we see a design as a series of boxes, it helps us digest a task that can sometimes feel overwhelming at first glance.



Review the Brief
TRAVEL CALIFORNIA
Hello, we are Travel California and we need a website developer to bring our vision of our new webpage to life. Our in-house designer did a pretty good job, but feel free to tweak our design if you feel like you have ideas that can make us better.
We like:

- Strong, legible fonts.
- Clear, well-defined sections.
- Lifestyle imagery that shows off the sights and scenery of California. The imagery must be crisp and make our viewers want to explore California.

Ways you can contribute:

- Many of our sections could use extra UI elements or features. Everything looks nice, but we wouldn’t mind more ways to interact with the webpage.
- Color scheme: If you want to explore another color palette, feel free! But try to stick to the style we have laid out in the design.
Our typography looks nice, but we are always open to other suggestions. Maybe you can add a font that feels more... adventurous?
